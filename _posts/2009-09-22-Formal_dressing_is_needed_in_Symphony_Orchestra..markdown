title: Formal dressing is needed in Symphony Orchestra.
---

<p>Although super-formal as Oscar isn&#8217;t that necessary, we still asked children to be formal dressing. For example, a decent dress is prefer to those T-shirt-and-jean/shorts. </p>
<p>Reluctantly, children found many excuses.<br />
Dresses are not comfortable as Tee and shorts;<br />
I don&#8217;t have a suitable dress;<br />
I just want to feel at ease, OK?<br />
Not all the People will dress formal, why we have to?<br />
Ridiculous! No!</p>
<p>Different occasions, different styles. Probably not everyone would have the same mind, but we should be in accordance with the convention we know.<br />
Try to walk in musicians&#8217; shoes, what’s you dream for from audiences?<br />
Respect and acknowledgement。</p>
<p>Some tips for parents:<br />
1. It’d better to prepare 1 to 2 formal dressing for children, in case for some formal/solemn occasions. Dresses for girls, as suits for boys.<br />
2. Teach and remind children what should/shouldn&#8217;t do in music hall. </p>
<p>But most importantly, parents are the best models as children are the best learners. </p>
