Last day I came to Shu’s place to help solve the HKBU application stuff.Well, she is the only one I can really trust in Shenzhen at this moment, just like my famlily member.

Every we meet, I want to show her my best situation.This time I wear my “Chance” from Channel.

Getting off the bus, suddenly I felt that it was not so comfortable to the smell from my body.Would she fell the same way?

She was so happy for my new look,you know, I wore a new glasses.Well,friends  around always surprised by my look of really like a designer. haha, actually I really wanted to be, maybe someday.

Being busy on the application form’s stuff, she said to me, maybe you should try another one, you smell like someone sophisticated but a young sunny girl. She was reading my mind,oh, my!How lucky I am to own such a smart girl friend. 

I like this Chance from Chanel, but I also feel that we are not perfect for each other this time or this age.Maybe I just don’t want to face my true feeling. So I need her word to help me out.

I think the meaning from Chance is that providing a chance to know ourselves  if we are really suitable for sth/someone, but not a chance to showoff her big name.

See, I am still back Chanel up, thanks for your chance, nice meeting you.
