Although super-formal as Oscar isn’t that necessary, we still asked children to be formal dressing. For example, a decent dress is prefer to those T-shirt-and-jean/shorts. 

Reluctantly, children found many excuses.

Dresses are not comfortable as Tee and shorts;

I don’t have a suitable dress;

I just want to feel at ease, OK?

Not all the People will dress formal, why we have to?

Ridiculous! No!

Different occasions, different styles. Probably not everyone would have the same mind, but we should be in accordance with the convention we know.

Try to walk in musicians’ shoes, what’s you dream for from audiences?

Respect and acknowledgement。

Some tips for parents:

1. It’d better to prepare 1 to 2 formal dressing for children, in case for some formal/solemn occasions. Dresses for girls, as suits for boys.

2. Teach and remind children what should/shouldn’t do in music hall. 

But most importantly, parents are the best models as children are the best learners.
