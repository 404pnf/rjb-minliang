No wonder time flies much faster than we imagine. From this September on, Coey is Form 1 in Shenzhen Foreign Language School. She is not that little girl anymore. Wow, what a surprise. 

What should I say to her? Teach her some tactic? Or warning?

After pondering for a few seconds, No matter what you would do, just try your best and donâ€™t regret. That was my best wishes.

Then I kissed her pinky and lovely face, She seemed understanding me again.
