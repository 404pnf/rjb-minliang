title: Thanks for my lovely Chance
---

<p>Last day I came to Shu&#8217;s place to help solve the HKBU application stuff.Well, she is the only one I can really trust in Shenzhen at this moment, just like my famlily member.<br />
Every we meet, I want to show her my best situation.This time I wear my &#8220;Chance&#8221; from Channel.</p>
<p>Getting off the bus, suddenly I felt that it was not so comfortable to the smell from my body.Would she fell the same way?<br />
She was so happy for my new look,you know, I wore a new glasses.Well,friends  around always surprised by my look of really like a designer. haha, actually I really wanted to be, maybe someday.<br />
Being busy on the application form&#8217;s stuff, she said to me, maybe you should try another one, you smell like someone sophisticated but a young sunny girl. She was reading my mind,oh, my!How lucky I am to own such a smart girl friend. </p>
<p>I like this Chance from Chanel, but I also feel that we are not perfect for each other this time or this age.Maybe I just don&#8217;t want to face my true feeling. So I need her word to help me out.<br />
I think the meaning from Chance is that providing a chance to know ourselves  if we are really suitable for sth/someone, but not a chance to showoff her big name.<br />
See, I am still back Chanel up, thanks for your chance, nice meeting you.
