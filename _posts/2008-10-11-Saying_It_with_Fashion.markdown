title: Saying It with Fashion
---

<p>在中环逛IFC的时候，顺手拿了一本小册子，saying it with fashion.<br />
Fashion or not，让Rachel欣赏一下金秋的服饰也是开阔眼界了。<br />
倒是对最后的一些人物专访感兴趣，some views are the same with mine.<br />
Personal style:<br />
Feminine, sometimes a little offbeat, sometimes dressy-it depends on the occasions that I need to dress for. But I normally mix a variety of last season and new season items.<br />
Trends:<br />
Black is always a staple, perfect to perk up any outfit.<br />
Staples for this season:<br />
Jeans, light top, tank top, or t-shirt and a jacket or sweater. I can always get by with just a thicker on top.<br />
Tips:<br />
I don’t think there is a rule or formula for people to dress and look their best. Simple and basic is golden rule for day time.<br />
Shopping habits:<br />
Listen to my heart and shop for whatever I feel like at that moment. Too stressful to shop for sth in particular on a need basis, so I just buy what I like and put it in my closet until I have the chance to wear it. Shopping should be a leisure activity, and this is the way I enjoy it. </p>
