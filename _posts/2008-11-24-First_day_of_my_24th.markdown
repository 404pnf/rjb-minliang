Thank you, <strong>Bobo</strong>. You sent the SMS at the moment of 12:00 of 23rd, but I found it after the breakfast.<br />
Thank you, <strong>Coey &#038; Rachel</strong>, you did remembered me while opening your eyes in 23rd morning;<br />
Thank you, <strong>Erica</strong>. I am honor getting your nice present from Holland, yet seems so mysteries to me;<br />
Thank you, <strong>Lianghong&#038; Lulu</strong>. That restaurant was actually a surprise, and the beautiful dream with the nice red wine. Well, there are few people can share dream together in our lives.<br />
Thank you, <strong>Rainbow</strong>. You brought a big surprise from Germany while white snow covers your city. We just can communicate through the technology, but we still share the same blue sky.<br />

Thank you, <strong>Lucy</strong>. Your advanced calling from NY was warm in this winter. I’m so lucky to have you been my big sister.<br />
You know that, dear friends. Maybe predestination, maybe luck, maybe, maybe, and maybe. Just may us enjoy the days of sunny, rainy, stormy, snowy……</p>
