These days there is sth wrong with Rachio’s sensitive skin. I think she does not feel at ease. Mother insisted she has to put on the uniform with long sleeves, which she doesn’t want to at all. The point is, she doesn’t want to be a freak in classmates’ eyes. Actually, I don’t think her classmates would thought she was a freak, they just be curious about it. And they just express their care to Rachio.

Even if how much I tell her, she still doesn’t want to put on them. What’s going on? Why not cares much about your health other than others’ feeling?

When you have such a girl? What should you do?

You will tell her many stories?

You will tell her, put on them right now! Period.

You will say, ok, suit yourself.

……….

One of the important require is know her feeling, in psychology it’s called“sympathy”, you have to really understand her, then you can help her. But if her doesn’t want to accept your opinion, just let her go. This is my advice.
