title: ! 'Should we beat the children '
---

<p>Last afternoon, shuang did her homework as usual. She played and worked, then played, chatted, and worked. Sometimes I really don’t know how to deal with her. I just let her know, if she couldn’t finish the homework on time, the English learning time will be cut automatically. She thought it is right, then back to be focus on the homework. But a little while later, she threw it back to me! Oh, my god!<br />
Her mother was mad about that, and couldn’t stand up with any more. she took the action-beating. She slapped on shuang’s back hardly, that we could hear about; and twisted the ears. And she even wanted to use the clothes-horse, but I stopped her. It was enough.<br />
Was mama right for that?<br />
Attention distraction is often the case among young pupils. The big words of good-good-study-and-day-day-up are no use at all. We have to let them know the actual results from not finish the homework on time. They have to lose something and they will begin to think and know how to do.<br />
Here, no compensation. I have to make it clear. We all know time cannot be back. We can get back to last minute.<br />
This is my words for beating. </p>
