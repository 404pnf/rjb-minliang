Good movie brings good mood. you can not deny talented work from Dreamwork, well, actually cool!

Who says penguins can’t fly?! God, I can say, they are the smartest and bravest and most team spirit in this movie, Bravo!

Good movie also pops out sth move, when giraffe said those words to GLORIA.

Damn it, tears rushed out from my eyes. What a naive action……But the same question in my mind, what do u love someone? And what is love actually? Still a puzzle with pieces spread every where.

Finally, Alex had proved itself to father, and Gloria found her true love…we got a happy ending and a full-of-popcorn stomach. 

Walking into cinema with your children and sharing huge laugh, maybe better than just sinking in textbooks.
