November 23, my 24th

Actually, I need to say thank you to you all.

Thank you, <strong>Mom</strong>. You are the first one calling, even thought there were still 2hrs to 23rd;

Thank you, <strong>Bobo</strong>. You sent the SMS at the moment of 12:00 of 23rd, but I found it after the breakfast.

Thank you, <strong>Coey & Rachel</strong>, you did remembered me while opening your eyes in 23rd morning;

Thank you, <strong>Erica</strong>. I am honor getting your nice present from Holland, yet seems so mysteries to me;

Thank you, <strong>Lianghong& Lulu</strong>. That restaurant was actually a surprise, and the beautiful dream with the nice red wine. Well, there are few people can share dream together in our lives.

Thank you, <strong>Rainbow</strong>. You brought a big surprise from Germany while white snow covers your city. We just can communicate through the technology, but we still share the same blue sky.

Thank you, <strong>Lucy</strong>. Your advanced calling from NY was warm in this winter. I’m so lucky to have you been my big sister.

You know that, dear friends. Maybe predestination, maybe luck, maybe, maybe, and maybe. Just may us enjoy the days of sunny, rainy, stormy, snowy……
