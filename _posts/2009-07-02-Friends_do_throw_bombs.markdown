title: Friends do throw bombs
---

<p>Good friends will always throw you a bomb, and stunned by themselves.<br />
1. My thudded, stuttered, and then picked up again in double time, by hearing such huge good news. Well, actually, it is good enough to deserve a congratulation smile.<br />
Congratulation, you will be an excellent mother. Although tough and hard, it’s worthy and noble. I just know that. </p>
<p>2. Broke up again!<br />
A peculiar sense of relieve for her, to me. I always believe in that, there must be something in fate, so don’t be sad and perplexed. Try to fend for yourself, concentrate on your own future, which is the most important thing. </p>
<p>3. Study abroad.<br />
Come on, another one would like to step out of China.<br />
Pursuing knowledge is the approach to fulfill our lives, which needs mind-boggling endeavor and passion, but not the best way to evade from reality, or “get some air”.<br />
For whoever’s sake, establish goal——measure the distance between your present ability and your goal——just do it but be focusing——who the hell care the final result?<br />
Don’t be “Wow”, trust me, please.
