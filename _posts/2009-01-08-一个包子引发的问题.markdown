title: 一个包子引发的问题
---

<p>晚上回来天翼正津津有味地啃着一个包子。本来让她把包子留给梁轩哥哥的，她没有答应，而是下车时候猛地咬了一口。大伙儿又好气又好笑。<br />
我则是有点愕然，这孩子一直很大方的啊~带着疑惑，我问了问天翼怎么回事？包子很好吃吧，或者是很饿了？天翼望了望我，没说话，继续啃包子。<br />
“包子我们经常可以吃得到，也不算贵，但是梁轩哥哥在美国就没什么机会吃到。”我一边故作叹气，一边观察她的反应。<br />
天翼慢了下来，“美国没有这种包子吃么？”<br />
我点了点头，“有是有的，但机会很少。”<br />
她似乎想说点什么，但也没说出来。<br />
After that, her father came in and told me about this. Actually I felt a little disappointed and let out some words: My view to you was changed just by a simple Baozi.<br />
Liangxuan would not eat that Baozi even if Rachel left it to him.<br />
Father wanted her to learn to share food even other things with other.<br />
This arouses me another thing on Coey. That night we just came back from piano lesson. So tired and so thirsty, we needed some water or juice. But after sitting on the sofa, coey began to cut a orange. Just for yourself? I wondered and asked her. She looked at me and reply, yes!Is there any problem?<br />
Is there any problem? I kept asking in my mind. At the same time, I couldn&#8217;t hide my anger, which appeared on my face.<br />
How could u just cut it for yourself? Have you ever consider aunt just beside you? your sister, and me?Have I ever cut the orange for myself before children? No! Sharing can bring us happy, is it really right for children? and whether the children are selfish or can be selfish at growing age?
