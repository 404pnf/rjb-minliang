title: Pls Hold Their Hands and Read Together
---

<p>I like picture story books, especially those with beautiful inside. From I was little girl, I just like to read books with pictures. I don’t think the book is good enough without any picture. Pictures can always bring us imagination, don’t they?<br />
I had been brought into a different world by Ms Sasaki, she taught me to read picture story book with a different view. Picture story books are not just some naïve stuff for children, but something we can learn life from so simple description.<br />
I like <em><strong>a dark dark tale</strong></em>, which cause giggle between my little sisters and me;<br />
I like <em><strong>Can’t you sleep little bear?</strong></em>, it teaches me why little bear need father bear;<br />
I like <em><strong>the snowman</strong></em>, everyone dreams to play with our own snowman;<br />
…………<br />
I know I am not a child again, and I know I am not pretend to be naïve again. I just like them and I appreciate them, recommend them.<br />
How many times we can meet picture story books? Triple.<br />
When you enjoy your childhood;<br />
When you become parents;<br />
When you are old enough, begin to live for yourself……<br />
Am I the last one? How about you? </p>
