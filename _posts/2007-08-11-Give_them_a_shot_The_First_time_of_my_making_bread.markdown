title: Give them a shot The First time of my making bread
---

<p>It was free this afternoon, and we decided to make some bread. Although the needs are standby, as well as the guiding book, I still had little hope for perfect bread. You know, practice makes perfect. Feel free to give a shot!<br />
First, mix the yeast and egg (2-3) together first with a small bowl of warm water, and put the flour, sugar in a big bowl;<br />
Next, pure the mixture of egg and yeast in to the flour bowl, they had to be stirred, and rub by hands. As rubbing, extra flour or water would be added. This thanks to my little cute assistant, Linda. She was so happy to give me a hand, and she can make small handwork with some bits and pieces.<br />
The dough stuck to my fingers. I had to beat the mixture until it has a light, puffy texture. It was not easy, even a little boring…Could I be a good cook, let’s see.<br />
After that, I put the dough into a clean big bowl, covering with a wet towel. Give it 45mins or an hour, it needs to breathe.<br />
We often use leaven when baking breads. Bread is raised with yeast (leaven).<br />
I decided to let these two children to give it a shot to make whatever they want to. Even if it will need a long time to wait for, plus a mess table. Children have lots of interest to many things, we must help them to try, to discover by themselves. All what we need to do are standing aside, just watching and keeping them from dangerous.</p>
<p>The little Linda kneaded the dough into a ball, or she wants to make a small girl. Her sister doesn’t know what to do at first. But she decided to make some twist of dough. Well done, honey! We are proud of you!<br />
When they were busy on their handwork, I had to figure out how to make that long-time-no-use oven work. It’s from CHEF, an Australia brand. Surf the internet, plus my some try, we did it! But what a smell! Forget it, the point is it can help us to turn the dough into bread. </p>
<p>I set 15mins, and we waited in front of it, sitting on the floor. Watching their small changes, the children broke into excited cheering every minute. Linda was so bursting, and could hardly wait to pull off the oven door. So cute they were!</p>
<p>Finally got the bread, oh, dear! They were burnt to cinders because of the honey on top. But the children still enjoyed their harvest, or could call them achievement. They ate them off! Not really, they left two for papa and mama, so that they could share our happiness.</p>
<p>In words, I think the interest and curiosity shouldn’t be stopped. Once they want to do by themselves, just let them go and try. They can learn more than the books. Parents always ignore that, especially in china, they would think it’s not a big deal; the good score in the papers are the most important and cheerful. What a pity!</p>
