title: ! 'What should I do Sis '
---

<p>No wonder time flies much faster than we imagine. From this September on, Coey is Form 1 in Shenzhen Foreign Language School. She is not that little girl anymore. Wow, what a surprise. </p>
<p>What should I say to her? Teach her some tactic? Or warning?<br />
After pondering for a few seconds, No matter what you would do, just try your best and don&#8217;t regret. That was my best wishes.<br />
Then I kissed her pinky and lovely face, She seemed understanding me again. </p>
