At 15, I just knew that to be excellent to get high school. That was all.

At 25, I change to put off my postgraduate plan to my second 5-year-plan; 

At 15, I just tasted something called crush to somebody;

At 25, I change to learn waiting for somebody, who can at my company in WHV plan. 

At 15, I wanted to escape from family;

At 25, I change to be relaxed from family pressure and support it, coz I know that we can’t choose parents, but we can choose our attitudes. 

At 15, I wanted to travel around the world;

At 25, I change to get WHV in 2012, working in New Zealand and enjoy one year holiday;

No need to wait until some certain age that you could know what/how to do, just plan and then, adjust, adjust again……
